# Lesson 1: Variables and Operators

We start this lesson by learning how to make a Java program.
We also introduced at the beginning the concept of comments
for your code. We also introduce how to "print" information to the screen.

In the proper part of the lesson, we cover what variables are in Java and
how to manipulate them with operators. We specifically
covered the following variable types: int (and friends),
double (and friends), String, and char.
